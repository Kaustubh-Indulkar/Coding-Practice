It contains C++ Concepts.
C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. It was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 at Bell Labs. C++ is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and performance, and it is widely used for developing system software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, and video games.

C++ supports object-oriented programming, generic programming, and procedural programming paradigms. It provides features such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exception handling. The language also includes standard libraries that provide a rich set of functions for performing various tasks.

C++ has a strong influence on other programming languages and is considered a powerful and versatile language for building complex and high-performance applications.
